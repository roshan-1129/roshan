The Random Joke App is a fun and interactive web application that fetches random programming jokes from an API and displays them to users. The app provides an entertaining way to pass the time with jokes, while also showcasing the use of API consumption and DOM manipulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Users can click a button to fetch a new joke, with the punchline revealed after a brief delay, adding an element of suspense to the experience. Additionally, the app allows users to share their favorite jokes on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook or copy the joke to their clipboard. The interface is designed with smooth animations when switching between jokes, including fade and slide transitions, making the app visually engaging.
